# Votechain
**A simple web based app for utilizing the power of blockchain in in a secured way which provides ability to vote with/without availability of the internet connectivity.**

 - With the use of azure blockchain and deployment of smart-contracts a simple web-app can be made with other dependencies like web3 or with the provided swagger-api or with azure blockchain workbench which can be used with internet connectivity present.
 - The other part(without internet connectivity) can be covered with the help of raspberry pi and creation of local server in the area where the network connectivity is not present. In this case  the votes given by the people must be stored in the raspberry pi itself and the votes must be transferred to the blockchain only when it gets connected to internet and under proper authorization.
 - The votes must be stored in the form of encrypted value in such a way that only a proper key can decrypt and verify that it has not been tampered with..
